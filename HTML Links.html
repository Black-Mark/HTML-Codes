1 First Steps
Welcome to Oracle VM VirtualBox.
Oracle VM VirtualBox is a cross-platform virtualization application. What does that mean? For
one thing, it installs on your existing Intel or AMD-based computers, whether they are running
Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, or Oracle Solaris operating systems (OSes). Secondly, it extends the
capabilities of your existing computer so that it can run multiple OSes, inside multiple virtual
machines, at the same time. As an example, you can run Windows and Linux on your Mac,
run Windows Server 2016 on your Linux server, run Linux on your Windows PC, and so on, all
alongside your existing applications. You can install and run as many virtual machines as you
like. The only practical limits are disk space and memory.
Oracle VM VirtualBox is deceptively simple yet also very powerful. It can run everywhere from
small embedded systems or desktop class machines all the way up to datacenter deployments
and even Cloud environments.
The following screenshot shows how Oracle VM VirtualBox, installed on an Apple Mac OS X
computer, is running Windows Server 2016 in a virtual machine window.
In this User Manual, we will begin simply with a quick introduction to virtualization and how
to get your first virtual machine running with the easy-to-use Oracle VM VirtualBox graphical
user interface. Subsequent chapters will go into much more detail covering more powerful tools
and features, but fortunately, it is not necessary to read the entire User Manual before you can
use Oracle VM VirtualBox.
You can find a summary of Oracle VM VirtualBoxâ€™s capabilities in chapter 1.3, Features
Overview, page 3. For existing Oracle VM VirtualBox users who just want to find out what is
new in this release, see the chapter 15, Change Log, page 305.

1 First Steps
1.1 Why is Virtualization Useful?
The techniques and features that Oracle VM VirtualBox provides are useful in the following
scenarios:
 Running multiple operating systems simultaneously. Oracle VM VirtualBox enables you
to run more than one OS at a time. This way, you can run software written for one OS on
another, such as Windows software on Linux or a Mac, without having to reboot to use it.
Since you can configure what kinds of virtual hardware should be presented to each such
OS, you can install an old OS such as DOS or OS/2 even if your real computerâ€™s hardware
is no longer supported by that OS.
 Easier software installations. Software vendors can use virtual machines to ship entire
software configurations. For example, installing a complete mail server solution on a real
machine can be a tedious task. With Oracle VM VirtualBox, such a complex setup, often
called an appliance, can be packed into a virtual machine. Installing and running a mail
server becomes as easy as importing such an appliance into Oracle VM VirtualBox.
 Testing and disaster recovery. Once installed, a virtual machine and its virtual hard disks
can be considered a container that can be arbitrarily frozen, woken up, copied, backed up,
and transported between hosts.
On top of that, with the use of another Oracle VM VirtualBox feature called snapshots, one
can save a particular state of a virtual machine and revert back to that state, if necessary.
This way, one can freely experiment with a computing environment. If something goes
wrong, such as prolems after installing software or infecting the guest with a virus, you
can easily switch back to a previous snapshot and avoid the need of frequent backups and
restores.
Any number of snapshots can be created, allowing you to travel back and forward in virtual
machine time. You can delete snapshots while a VM is running to reclaim disk space.
 Infrastructure consolidation. Virtualization can significantly reduce hardware and electricity
costs. Most of the time, computers today only use a fraction of their potential power
and run with low average system loads. A lot of hardware resources as well as electricity
is thereby wasted. So, instead of running many such physical computers that are only partially
used, one can pack many virtual machines onto a few powerful hosts and balance the
loads between them.
1.2 Some Terminology
When dealing with virtualization, and also for understanding the following chapters of this documentation,
it helps to acquaint oneself with a bit of crucial terminology, especially the following
terms:
 Host operating system (host OS). This is the OS of the physical computer on which Oracle
VM VirtualBox was installed. There are versions of Oracle VM VirtualBox for Windows,
Mac OS X, Linux, and Oracle Solaris hosts. See chapter 1.4, Supported Host Operating
Systems, page 5.
Most of the time, this manual discusses all Oracle VM VirtualBox versions together. There
may be platform-specific differences which we will point out where appropriate.
 Guest operating system (guest OS). This is the OS that is running inside the virtual machine.
Theoretically, Oracle VM VirtualBox can run any x86 OS. such as DOS, Windows, OS/2,
FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. But to achieve near-native performance of the guest code on your
machine, we had to go through a lot of optimizations that are specific to certain OSes. So
2
1 First Steps
while your favorite OS may run as a guest, we officially support and optimize for a select
few, which include the most common OSes.
See chapter 3.1, Supported Guest Operating Systems, page 40.
 Virtual machine (VM). This is the special environment that Oracle VM VirtualBox creates
for your guest OS while it is running. In other words, you run your guest OS in a VM.
Normally, a VM will be shown as a window on your computerâ€™s desktop, but depending on
which of the various frontends of Oracle VM VirtualBox you use, it can be displayed in full
screen mode or remotely on another computer.
In a more abstract way, internally, Oracle VM VirtualBox thinks of a VM as a set of parameters
that determine its behavior. They include hardware settings, such as: how much memory
the VM should have, what hard disks Oracle VM VirtualBox should virtualize through
which container files, what CDs are mounted. They also include state information, such as:
whether the VM is currently running, saved, if the VM has snapshots. These settings are
mirrored in the VirtualBox Manager window, as well as the VBoxManage command. See
chapter 8, VBoxManage, page 120. In other words, a VM is also what you can see in its
Settings dialog.
 Guest Additions. This refers to special software packages which are shipped with Oracle VM
VirtualBox but designed to be installed inside a VM to improve performance of the guest
OS and to add extra features. See chapter 4, Guest Additions, page 62.
1.3 Features Overview
The following is a brief outline of Oracle VM VirtualBoxâ€™s main features:
 Portability. Oracle VM VirtualBox runs on a large number of 32-bit and 64-bit host OS.
See chapter 1.4, Supported Host Operating Systems, page 5.
Oracle VM VirtualBox is a so-called hosted hypervisor, sometimes referred to as a type 2
hypervisor. Whereas a bare-metal or type 1 hypervisor would run directly on the hardware,
Oracle VM VirtualBox requires an existing OS to be installed. It can thus run alongside
existing applications on that host.
To a very large degree, Oracle VM VirtualBox is functionally identical on all of the host
platforms, and the same file and image formats are used. This enables you to run virtual
machines created on one host on another host with a different host OS. For example, you
can create a virtual machine on Windows and then run it under Linux.
In addition, virtual machines can easily be imported and exported using the Open Virtualization
Format (OVF), an industry standard created for this purpose. You can even
import OVFs that were created with a different virtualization software. See chapter 1.15,
Importing and Exporting Virtual Machines, page 21.
 No hardware virtualization required. For many scenarios, Oracle VM VirtualBox does
not require the processor features built into newer hardware like Intel VT-x or AMD-V. As
opposed to many other virtualization solutions, you can therefore use Oracle VM VirtualBox
even on older hardware where these features are not present. See chapter 10.3, Hardware
vs. Software Virtualization, page 270.
 Guest Additions: shared folders, seamless windows, 3D virtualization. The Oracle
VM VirtualBox Guest Additions are software packages which can be installed inside of supported
guest systems to improve their performance and to provide additional integration
and communication with the host system. After installing the Guest Additions, a virtual
machine will support automatic adjustment of video resolutions, seamless windows, accelerated
3D graphics and more. See chapter 4, Guest Additions, <a name="last page">page 62.</a></p><br>
